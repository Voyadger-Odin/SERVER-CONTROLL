Markdown
========

Rich can render Markdown to the console. To render markdown, construct a :class:`~rich.markdown.Markdown` object then print it to the console. Markdown is a great way of adding rich content to your command line applications. Here's an example of use::

    MARKDOWN = """
    # This is an h1

    Rich can do a pretty *decent* job of rendering markdown.

    1. This is a list item
    2. This is another list item
    """
    from rich.console import Console
    from rich.markdown import Markdown

    console = Console()
    md = Markdown(MARKDOWN)
    console.print(md)

Note that code blocks are rendered with full syntax highlighting!

You can also use the Markdown class from the command line. The following example displays a readme in the terminal::

    python -m rich.markdown README.md

Run the following to see the full list of arguments for the markdown command::

    python -m rich.markdown -h
